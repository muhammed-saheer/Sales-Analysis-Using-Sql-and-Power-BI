# Sales Analysis using SQL & Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on improving sales reporting by transitioning from static reports to interactive Power BI dashboards. The analysis is based on the AdventureWorksDW2019 database, with data extracted, cleaned, and transformed using SQL before visualizing key insights in Power BI.

## 🎯 Project Goals
### What I Wanted to Do:
- Improve sales reporting by creating dynamic dashboards.
- Analyze sales trends over time.
- Identify top-selling products and key customers.
- Compare actual sales performance with budgeted targets.
- Enable filtering by salesperson, product, and customer.

### What I Did:
1. **Restored Database**: Loaded AdventureWorksDW2019_DatesUpdated.bak into SQL Server.
2. **Extracted & Cleaned Data**: Used SQL scripts to extract required tables:
   - DIM_Product
   - DIM_Calendar
   - DIM_Customer
   - FACT_InternetSales
3. **Saved Cleaned Data**:
   - Exported query results to CSV format.
4. **Loaded Data into Power BI**:
   - Connected CSV files to Power BI.
   - Created relationships between tables.
5. **Built Three Dashboards**:
   - **Sales Overview**
   - **Product Overview**
   - **Customer Overview**
